# Overview
Why do some areas have more crime than others? Why do some areas see increasing rates of crime over time, while others seemingly do not? These are the primary questions to answer in the current course. Specifically, this course looks at: 1) the spatial concentration pattern of crime; 2) the characteristics of places that promote criminal activity, and 3) those features of places that increase or decrease crime. We consider the principal theoretical perspectives that link crime to place, the research methods that have been used to study spatial patterns of crime, and classic and contemporary theoretical and methodological investigations of the relationship between place and crime.

# Objectives
The student will obtain an understanding of:
(1) Perspectives on the spatial variation on crime: Situational and spatial explanations
(2) The historical development of the ecological explanations of crime.
(3) Significant milestones in the development of place-level explanations of crime.

# Readings
The required readings for this course can be downloaded as *.pdf documents from the course website. The readings will generally be posted to the website one lecture in advance, will stay through the lecture for which they are assigned. There will be two or three required readings per week.
